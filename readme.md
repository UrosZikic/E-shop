E-shop is an online shop designed for small business owners.

NOTE: this is a simple version of my store website, to access the complete product, contact me via my email.
The complete product builds on the existing store and brings its own additions:

1. unique products page with filtering capabilities and pagination
2. search bar functionality for easier product navigation
3. additional pages
4. improved new layout, theme and styles
5. new engaging content

The V1 E-shop is built with my personal in-house solutions. The technologies used to build the website were:
1. PHP
2. SQL
3. JS
4. CSS

V1 E-shop is a simple but functional online shop website. It provides:
1. Landing page with a carousel of products and a mailing form service (both completely functional)
2. Product page which dynamically adapts to each product called from my SQL database
3. Cart page which stores selected products and allows quantity change and product removal
4. Checkout page which provides a payment form and the overview of all the carted products
